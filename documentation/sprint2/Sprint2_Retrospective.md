|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Aniol & Sergi    | We had problems on marking a room as `is_cleaned`. This field is duplicated and needs to be reproached.                                    |
| Aniol & Júlia    | For the restaurant reservations the reservations need to be filtered and have the ability to mark a reservation as the client has arrived. |
| Abdellah & Aniol | The bills need to be improved since they are too basic and don't provide enough information.                                               |
| Aniol            | The database is not working properly in production, this issue needs to be addressed at the next Sprint.                                   |
