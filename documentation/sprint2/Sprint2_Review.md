## Burn-down Graph

The sprint started with a lot of issues, but this time there have been creating more issues over the course of the
Sprint. The team was able to solve them and deliver the project on time. But there have been bugs that had to be solved
last time and some tests were not implemented in time. In general the team has started working well but a bit late so
the last days of the sprint had to be worked hard to deliver the project on time.

## Burn-up (Velocity) Graph

In this chart it can be seen that the team started working on the project a bit late, but since there have been exams
and other projects to be done, the team has worked hard to deliver the project on time. The velocity has increased over
the course of the Sprint, but it has not been linear. This is something that needs to be improved.
