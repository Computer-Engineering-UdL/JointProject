## Problems/Difficulties

| Problem | Task                            | Owner | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| P1      | DB had problems with migrations | Aniol | Some expenses fields had removed reservations id and migrations were not working. Those rows have been removed and it has been added a new field in the `populate` url to populate the despenses and the extra costs for the reservations.                                           |
| P2      | Checkout not working            | Aniol | Checkout process was not working as intended since the reservation wasn't registering the new changes when the checkout process was applied.                                                                                                                                         |
| P3      | Checkout test                   | Aniol | Since the checkout 3 view had to be fixed (as specified in the previous problem), some reception tests needed to be changed to adjust to the new checkout process.                                                                                                                   |
| P4      | Restaurant reservation date     | Aniol | When creating a new restaurant reservation the input date was allowing users to make new reservations for more than a year ahead. This issue has been fixed and a restaurant config attribute has been added to specify the maximum time ahead to make a new restaurant reservation. |
